# Deep Aim

Deep Aim is a WebXR shooting project built with React Three Fiber.

## Development

This project uses **npm**, not Yarn.

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the Vite development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## React version note

`react` and `react-dom` must use the same version.

Check the installed versions with:

```bash
npm ls react react-dom
```

If the dependency state becomes inconsistent, stop the development server, delete:

```text
node_modules
package-lock.json
```

and reinstall:

```bash
npm install
```

## GitHub Pages

The project is deployed with **GitHub Actions** rather than directly serving the repository root.

GitHub Pages:

https://orangehermit.github.io/deepaim/

The Vite configuration must use:

```js
base: "/deepaim/"
```

Deployment workflow:

```text
.github/workflows/deploy.yml
```

A push to `main` triggers a production build and deploys the generated `dist` directory to GitHub Pages.
